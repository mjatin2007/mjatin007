<h3><u>Discussion</u></h3>
<p>
The Mimer project was a challenging yet a very deep and impacting project which I have done to this date. It was a new experience as I have never handler batch
files before and got to know the varios types of responses from servers on to the client browsers. I used my previous mywebserver and enhanced it for this project
as this time it has to handle a new type of mime .xyz extension. Chrome and Opera web browsers gave me a lot of issues as they wont allow opening cutomized file types.
Hence it is advised to go with firefox as it wont cause any trouble.
</p>
<p>
Download the mimer-data.xyz from the website and place it in your webserver files. Make sure that the web-server is edited appropriately when the .xyz fileis accessed
and you get the results on your shell. Next download the shim.dat file on to your local computer and open the mimer-data.xyz file. The system may ask you to select custom
program to open such kind of files. Select shim.bat to open the file. Open you MyWebserver and run it and also start firefox parallely. Now access "localhost:2540/mimer-data.xyz"
and check if its working properly. Upon running shell will open and you can check the mimer-data.xyz in the shell command.
</p>
<p>
Next, in tne mimer project page professor elleiot has provided us handler.java file copy it and compile the program. Edit the shim.bat file by remving the comment
in the last line in such a way that it looks like this "java -Dfirstarg=%1 Handler". This statement will now freely execute. Now, enter "shim mimer-data.xyz" in the
command shell. I recieved: <br>
C:\Users\Jatin\Desktop\MyWebserver>java -Dfirstarg=mimer-data.xyz Handler<br>
Executing the java application.<br>
First var is: mimer-data.xyz<br>
Data is: One partridge in a pear tree<br>
Data is: Two turtle doves<br>
Data is: Three French hens<br>
Data is: Four calling birds<br>
Data is: Five golden rings<br>
i is: 6<br>
A file will be created at this location C:\Temp\mimer.output. Also uncomment the class path in the shim bat file in 3rd to he last line.
</p>
<p>
Next, in your browser access the mimer-data.xyz file through, localhost:2540/mimer-data.xyz. Copy the BCClient.java file and run it on your system. Before, you do that
please make sure that you have downloaded the xstream java files and placed them in the jdk library. This has really created a headache for me as the xstream was not getting detected by
the program when I was trying to run it. Now dowload the jcxclient.bat and rcxclient.bat file on your server root folder and edit the path in the last line which points to the xstream 
files in the jdk libraries which we downloaded earlier. This will be for our BCClient.java. Now run the BCClient.java
</p>
<p>
Now, the next part included a bit of coding. In this back channel capacity was given to the MyWebServer.java file by adding the snippet as provided my professor Elliot.
Apart from this Xstream was added to handle an deserialize the xml content. This also printed the xml and the object on the cosnole. The next subpart of this step
was to bring together the BCClient and the Handler programs which was a bit challenging as initalially it gave me lot of bugs and took a while for me to debug
all of them. Also occasionally, you need to check the mimer.outpu file in the tempirary files and check if the file location is correct as it also makes the 
program fall apart often.

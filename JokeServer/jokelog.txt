>Java JokeClient.java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
        at JokeClient.main(JokeClient.java:49)

Couldnt resolve the Joke Clientexception error which I was getting. Previously was working and giving jokes. I believe
if this exception is resolved the code should run fine


>Java JokeServer
Starting JokeServer at port no. 4545.
java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind
// The Joke server is running well and good

Press 'y' to know the state of the server and 'n' to quit

//The JokeClientAdmin is also giving exception errors I couldnt resolve.
